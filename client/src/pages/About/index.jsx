            <p>Magic is memory.</p>
            <p>Third Eye Design's work is rooted in the desire to unbury the past, blending traditonal beliefs and stories with contemporary vision to create prints, coloring pages, and other products that are part spellwork, part storytelling. We create for those who find magic in every corner, who ask questions, and who keep old stories alive by retelling them with new voices.</p>
            <p>Third Eye Designs doesn't separate the mystical from the mundane. Spellwork lives in sketchbooks, in sticker sheets, in the quiet act of coloring a world you recognize as your own. This is a space where folklore meets feminism, where art becomes a ritual, and where the gothic and the joyful live side by side â€” fierce and fully seen.</p>
